# Bank-Loan-Project

##Overview:
We are aiming to create a comprehensive loan analysis dashboard that helps track and understand key aspects of our loan portfolio. The goal is to provide clear insights into loan application trends, funding, repayments, and borrower characteristics. By doing so, we can improve decision-making, spot trends, and analyze financial health across different periods and regions.

##Key Objectives:
Monitor Loan Applications:

Calculate the total loan applications during specific periods.
Track Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications.
Measure Month-over-Month (MoM) changes to spot growth or decline.
Analyze Funded Amounts:

Track the total funded amount disbursed as loans.
Monitor the MTD funded amount and its MoM changes to assess funding consistency.
Track Repayments:

Measure the total amount received from borrowers.
Keep track of MTD and MoM repayment amounts to monitor cash flow.
Understand Lending Costs:

Calculate the average interest rate on loans.
Track MTD interest rates and MoM changes for insights into lending cost trends.
Assess Borrower Health:

Calculate the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio to assess the financial health of borrowers.
Monitor MTD and MoM fluctuations to ensure sustainable lending.

##Visualizations & Insights:
Create visual representations that allow users to easily track and interpret the data:

Monthly Trends to spot seasonality and trends.

Regional Analysis to identify high-activity areas and assess regional disparities.

Loan Term Distribution to understand which loan terms are most popular.

Employee Length Analysis to explore how employment history impacts loan applications.

Loan Purpose Breakdown to understand why borrowers are taking loans.

Home Ownership Impact on loan applications and disbursements.
Details Dashboard:

The Details Dashboard will be a central location for all essential loan-related metrics. It will offer users a holistic view of the loan portfolio, including application, funding, repayment, and borrower data, enabling quick decision-making and deeper insights into lending performance.
